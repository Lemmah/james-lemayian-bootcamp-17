"""
This is a test case for the loan calculator, a function that I suppose should:
    0. Calculate the payable amount accurately when the paramaters are passed
    1. Accept number inputs which are: borrowed_amount, time_payable (in months), percentage_rate
    2. Ensure a loan is repayed within 12 months (I don't know why...we just decided to do this in class.)
    3. Set a minimum amount of borrowable loan of 5 thousand. (You cannot just borrow any amount, like 5 bob makes no sense.)
    4. Ensures that all the inputs are positive numbers ie greater than zero. You borrow a loan with a negative interest, it simply means you wont pay.
    5. Prohibits someone from borrowing a loan greater than 10 million. Assumption is it is a microfinancing thing.
This test is supposed to ensure that my function passes all the required tests.
